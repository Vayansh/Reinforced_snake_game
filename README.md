# Snake Game

Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a growing line that becomes a primary obstacle to itself. 
The concept originated in the 1976 two-player arcade game Blockade from Gremlin Industries, and the ease of 
implementation has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for 
many platforms. 1982's Tron arcade game, based on the film, includes snake gameplay for the single-player Light 
Cycles segment. After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest 
in snake games as it found a larger audience.

# Reinforced Learning 

Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a
particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it 
should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in 
supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer 
itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to 
perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.
